What a year this had been....was fortunate to experience a range of emotions that i had never felt before....some good..some bad....days to reminisnce by....days to ponder by...and the future yet to come....what will happen who knows....but its best to be calm and live in the present....coz this present will just pass by...in the shadows of time that we live by....who knows if this story will end or continue with a new beggining....but to start it needs to ends the previous chapter of another life....for it is hard to understand the secrets of heart....if its broken or just fading apart.
